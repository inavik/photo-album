This was a class assignment that allowed us to select and manipulate elements using jQuery to build a small photo album app.

In the separate Javascript file, we added a class to zoom all images when they're clicked upon and included the next/previous buttons on each image.

This photo album was a great practice for utilizing jQuery.
